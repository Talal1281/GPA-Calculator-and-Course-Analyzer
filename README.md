# GPA-Calculator-and-Course-Analyzer

This project streamlines academic performance management and analysis. Developed with Python, utilizing the Tkinter and pandas libraries, it provides a GUI for calculating CGPA, analyzing course contributions, and generating detailed CSV / PDF reports.


### Description

- **Automatically CGPA Calculator**: Users can upload a CSV file containing course names, GPAs, and credits. The tool then automatically calculates the GPA from this data, providing detailed insights and a comprehensive breakdown of academic performance.
 
- **Manual CGPA Calculator**: The application allows users to add course information manually through a dedicated interface. Each course can be entered with its name, the GPA achieved, and the credit hours. This data is stored in a list and utilized for various calculations, such as CGPA.
  
- **CGPA Analysis**: This feature assesses the influence of each course on the student's overall CGPA, with a particular focus on credit contributions. Data is visually represented in a pie chart and clearly detailed in the PDF report, offering an intuitive understanding of how individual courses impact academic performance.
  
- **Target GPA Estimation**: This functionality enables users to specify a desired CGPA and discover the necessary course load and required GPA per course to achieve it. The program calculates and suggests the number of additional courses along with the GPA needed for each, facilitating effective academic planning and goal setting.
  
- **Report Generation**: This feature allows users to create PDF or CSV reports, along with pie charts, that visualize course weights and the distribution of CGPA
